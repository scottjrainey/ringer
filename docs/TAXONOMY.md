# Model identity taxonomy

This document is Ringer's normative contract for model identity. Every scoreboard surface must be able to answer: **which lab's model, in which harness, on whose plan, at what effort?** These fields describe different things and must not be conflated.

## Model

A model is a trained artifact produced by a lab. A model name is never a test-fixture name, harness product name, CLI name, or billing plan. When a harness explicitly sets reasoning effort, the model's scoreboard identity includes that effort.

Registry aliases are allowed only when the actual model lineage is not established. They must be marked as aliases in both the registry and the displayed name; they must not be presented as a confirmed model lineage.

## Lab

The lab is the organization that trained the model, such as OpenAI, xAI, Z.ai (Zhipu AI), Moonshot AI, NVIDIA, Meta, or Cursor (Anysphere). A harness, CLI, OAuth plan, or API provider is never a lab.

Registered models use the lab recorded in `registry/model-identity.toml`. An unregistered OpenRouter slug may show its organization segment with `?` as an explicitly unverified best-effort value. Other unregistered models show `(unknown)`.

## Harness

The harness is the agent shell that invokes the model: Codex CLI, Grok Build CLI, or OpenCode. It runs a model but does not become the model or its lab.

## Access/Plan

Access/Plan describes billing and access, such as an OAuth plan or the OpenRouter API. It does not identify the trained model, its lab, or its harness.

## Reasoning effort

Reasoning effort is part of model identity when the effective harness invocation sets it. Ringer records only explicit values; it never guesses a harness-side default. If any run for a model records effort, that model's buckets display the recorded value or `(effort unrecorded)` so unlike configurations remain separate. Harnesses and models with no recorded effort remain unsuffixed.

## Reserved fixture names

The names `proven-model`, `probation-model`, `mock-model`, and `test-model` are reserved for tests. Raw log rows may retain them, but they are excluded from every scoreboard aggregation, ranking, tier, JSON payload, and HTML surface and will never display.

## Unattributed rows

An unattributed row is a historical log row whose `model` field is empty or blank. It is not a run where the manifest omitted a model and Ringer resolved and stamped the engine default at write time.

Unattributed rows are quarantined per engine under `(unattributed legacy rows)`. They remain visible at the bottom of the scoreboard for data transparency, but they are never credited to an engine default or any real model, never receive a proven/probation tier, and never receive a rank. Their results cannot establish a model's record because their actual model identity is unknown.
